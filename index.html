  <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment -</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement starts from the bare-bones of a website, the content, and builds up from there. Graceful degradation focuses on catering to the most high end users of their content while only barely making the content passable in older browsers or less popular formats. 
</p>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement prioritizes HTML and makes sure the content is well structured there before moving on to CSS or javascript and ensures that the content is still consumable without those two. In my opinion this is important because, today even more than ever, our content on the web is being consumed in so many different formats. Imagine if you were recruited to build a website for a client but only half of your clients' customers could access the website, I don't imagine your client would be very happy with that. It is also important to remember to maintain accessibility for people with disabilities.

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection - </h2>
  <p>For my final project I did the Dragon Microsite. I feel like I wrote the HTML pretty well. My first rendition of the HTML validated without me having to make any changes. I liked the way I grouped things but it took me a few tries to get the CSS the way I liked it. I had to do a lot of research and reference sites and tutorials to even get it to look decent. I really struggled with getting the CSS selectors the way I liked them and then to get the margin/padding to work out as I'm still not 100% confident working with those.
</p>
  <p>If I had to start over, I would do more research in the beginning to have more of a plan of what I want my site to end up looking like, and I would also try and plan out the HTML/CSS selectors a little better to make writing the CSS a little easier and cleaner. For the revision of the Dragon project I had 2 friends and 1 family member review the site. From them I got the feed-back to:
Improve the readability of the site, Fix the nav buttons so the text was still readable when hovered over and to change to background. Of these changes I implemented all of them except to change the background. I decided this for two reasons, I like the way my background looks and was only asked to change it for the aethstetic, and this is really the best looking background I know how to implement at this time.
</p>
  <p>Overall I enjoyed working on the dragon project and was proud of the product I was able to produce and I also learned a lot about solving little problems that come up throughout the course of a project.
